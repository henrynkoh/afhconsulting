### Content

**Introduction**

Sarah was exhausted. Running a 6-bed Adult Family Home with all Medicaid residents, she was working 24/7, barely breaking even, and watching her staff turnover rate climb. Her monthly revenue was $27,000, but after expenses, she was left with only $3,000-$5,000 in profit—hardly enough to justify the constant stress and responsibility.

Then everything changed.

In this comprehensive case study, we'll walk through Sarah's complete transformation: how she increased her monthly revenue from $27,000 to $57,000 using the strategies taught in the AFH Financial Masterclass. This isn't a theory—it's a real story with real numbers.

**The Starting Point: The Medicaid Trap**

Sarah's home was in a rural area with a median home value of $350,000. She accepted any resident who needed care, charging a flat rate of $4,500 per month regardless of care level. All six beds were filled with Medicaid residents.

**Monthly Breakdown (Before)**:
- Revenue: $27,000 (6 residents × $4,500)
- Staffing costs: $15,000
- Food & supplies: $2,400
- Utilities & maintenance: $1,800
- Net profit: $7,800
- Owner's draw (after accounting for her time): $3,000-$5,000

Sarah was trapped in what we call the "Medicaid Trap": high volume, low margin, vulnerable to state budget cuts, and unsustainable long-term.

**The Transformation: Step-by-Step**

**Step 1: Strategic Site Selection**

Sarah's first move was understanding the "5-Mile Rule." She realized that private-pay families (usually adult children aged 45-65) choose homes within 5 miles of their residence. Her current location was 10 miles from the nearest high-wealth area.

**Action**: Sarah relocated her search to a suburban area with a median home value of $1.2 million, just 3 miles from a major hospital.

**Step 2: Transition to Private Pay**

Instead of accepting any resident, Sarah became selective. She implemented a financial screening process requiring:
- Bank statements (last 3 months)
- Investment account statements
- Proof of 24+ months of private funds

**Action**: Over 6 months, Sarah transitioned from 100% Medicaid to 100% private-pay residents.

**Step 3: Tiered Pricing Implementation**

Sarah moved from flat-rate pricing to level-of-care pricing:

- **Base Room & Board**: $5,500/month
- **Level 1 Care**: +$1,500/month
- **Level 2 Care**: +$2,500/month
- **Level 3 Care**: +$4,000/month

**Action**: Sarah's average monthly rate per resident increased from $4,500 to $9,500.

**Step 4: Building Referral Networks**

Sarah built relationships with:
- Hospital discharge planners (4-hour response time)
- Hospice agencies
- Wealth managers
- Elder law attorneys

**Action**: Within 3 months, Sarah had a waiting list of private-pay families.

**The Results: After Transformation**

**Monthly Breakdown (After)**:
- Revenue: $57,000 (6 residents, average $9,500/month)
- Staffing costs: $21,000 (premium 1:3 ratio)
- Food & supplies: $3,600 (premium quality)
- Utilities & maintenance: $2,400
- Net profit: $30,000
- Owner's draw: $20,000+

**Key Metrics Comparison**:

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Monthly Revenue | $27,000 | $57,000 | +111% |
| Net Profit | $7,800 | $30,000 | +285% |
| Owner's Draw | $3,000-$5,000 | $20,000+ | +400% |
| Staff-to-Resident Ratio | 1:6 | 1:3 | 2x better |
| Private Pay Ratio | 0% | 100% | Complete transition |
