### Main Content

**Welcome, [First Name]!**

Thank you for joining the AFH Success Consultant community. You're about to discover the strategies that separate struggling AFH operations from thriving, profitable businesses.

**This Week's Focus: The 5-Mile Rule**

One of the most important concepts in AFH site selection is the "5-Mile Rule." Private-pay families (usually adult children aged 45-65) typically choose homes within 5 miles of their residence or office.

**Why This Matters:**
- Proximity = Peace of mind
- Quick emergency response
- Regular visits without long drives
- Maintained social connections

**Action Step**: Map your target market. Identify zip codes with median home values of $750K+ and draw a 5-mile radius around each. This is where your private-pay clients live.

**Success Story Spotlight**

Sarah increased her monthly revenue from $27K to $57K by:
1. Relocating to a high-wealth area
2. Transitioning to 100% private-pay
3. Implementing tiered pricing
4. Building referral networks

## Newsletter Issue 2: Pricing Strategies

### Subject Line
Stop Leaving Money on the Table: Tiered Pricing Secrets

### Preheader Text
Why flat rates are killing your profit margins

### Main Content

**This Week: Tiered Pricing Strategies**

The biggest mistake new AFH owners make? Charging a flat rate regardless of care needs.

**The Problem:**
A resident requiring 2-person transfers and heavy incontinence care costs you 3x more in staff time than a basic ADL resident. But if you charge the same rate, you're absorbing that cost.

**The Solution: Level-of-Care Pricing**

**Base Room & Board**: $5,500/month
- Private room, meals, housekeeping

**Level 1 Care**: +$1,500/month
- Basic ADL assistance

**Level 2 Care**: +$2,500/month
- Moderate care, incontinence management

**Level 3 Care**: +$4,000/month
- Intensive care, two-person transfers

**Daily Rate Formula**

```
Daily Rate = (Monthly Rate × 12) ÷ 365
```

Example: $8,500/month = $279.45/day

**Why Daily Rates?**
- Accounts for 31-day months
- Simplifies prorated billing
- More transparent for families

**This Week's Case Study**

John implemented tiered pricing and increased his average monthly rate from $4,500 to $9,200 per resident. His revenue increased by 104% with the same number of beds.

### Subject Line
How to Attract $8.5K+/Month Private-Pay Residents

### Preheader Text
The 4-hour rule that makes you the discharge planner's favorite

### Main Content

**This Week: Building Your Referral Network**

Hospital discharge planners are under massive pressure to "clear the bed." Your value proposition: "I can be at the hospital within 4 hours to do the assessment."

This reliability makes you their favorite partner.

**Key Referral Sources:**

1. **Hospital Discharge Planners**
   - 4-hour response time
   - Specialized care capabilities
   - High-budget cases

2. **Hospice Agencies**
   - End-of-life care specialization
   - Short-term, high-revenue residents
   - Premium rates justified

3. **Wealth Managers**
   - High-net-worth families
   - Pre-planned care
   - Premium positioning

**The "Concierge" Tour Strategy**

Your tour must justify a $9K/month price tag. Every detail matters:

✅ Home is spotless (no odors, fresh flowers)
✅ Residents are engaged (not watching TV alone)
✅ Staff is visible and professional
✅ Marketing materials ready
✅ Sample meal prepared

**Value Comparison Framework**

When families say "$8,500 is too much," show them:

- Large Facility: $6,500-$7,500 (with add-ons)
- Your AFH: $8,500 (all-inclusive)
- Plus: 1:3 ratio vs 1:15-20, <2 min response vs 15-30 min
