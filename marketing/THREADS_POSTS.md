## Educational Threads

### Thread 1: The 5-Mile Rule

**Post 1**:
```
The 5-Mile Rule: Why location is everything in AFH business 🗺️

Private-pay families (usually adult children 45-65) typically choose homes within 5 miles of their residence or office.

Why? Proximity = peace of mind.

They want to:
- Visit regularly without long drives
- Respond quickly in emergencies
- Maintain social connections

This is why high-wealth zip codes matter. More in thread 👇
```

**Post 2**:
```
So what does this mean for your AFH?

If you're in a $350K median home value area, but 10 miles away is a $1.2M area, you're missing your target market.

The affluent families won't drive 10 miles when they can find care within 5.

Solution: Relocate your search to the high-wealth area.

The 5-Mile Rule isn't just a suggestion—it's a financial reality.
```

**Post 3**:
```
Action step: Map your target market

1. Identify zip codes with median home values $750K+
2. Draw a 5-mile radius around each
3. Count existing AFHs in those areas
4. Look for gaps (especially private-pay gaps)

If you find an area with 15 AFHs but 12 accept Medicaid, that's an OPPORTUNITY, not saturation.

Premium private-pay homes are in high demand.

### Thread 2: Pricing Strategy

**Post 1**:
```
Stop leaving money on the table 💰

The biggest mistake new AFH owners make? Charging a flat rate regardless of care needs.

A resident requiring 2-person transfers and heavy incontinence care costs you 3x more in staff time than a basic ADL resident.

But if you charge the same rate, you're absorbing that cost.

Solution: Level-of-care pricing 👇
```

**Post 2**:
```
Level-of-Care Pricing Structure:

Base Room & Board: $5,500/month
- Private room, meals, housekeeping

Level 1 (Basic ADL): +$1,500/month
- Bathing, dressing, medication reminders

Level 2 (Moderate): +$2,500/month
- Incontinence, specialized diets, behavioral monitoring

Level 3 (Intensive): +$4,000/month
- Two-person transfers, wound care, dementia care

This ensures you're paid for the care you provide.
```

**Post 3**:
```
Daily Rate Calculation:

(Monthly Rate × 12) ÷ 365 = Daily Rate

Example: $8,500/month
($8,500 × 12) ÷ 365 = $279.45/day

Why daily rates?
✅ Accounts for 31-day months
✅ Simplifies prorated billing
✅ More transparent for families

Don't use flat rates. Use tiered pricing based on actual care needs.
```

### Thread 3: Marketing to Private Pay

**Post 1**:
```
How to attract $8.5K+/month private-pay residents 🎯

It's not about having an open bed. It's about being the SOLUTION to their problem.

Hospital discharge planners are under pressure to "clear the bed."

Your value proposition: "I can be at the hospital within 4 hours to do the assessment."

This reliability makes you their favorite partner.

More strategies in thread 👇
```

**Post 2**:
```
The "Concierge" Tour Strategy:

Your tour must justify a $9K/month price tag. Every detail matters:

✅ Home is spotless (no odors, fresh flowers)
✅ Residents are engaged (not watching TV alone)
✅ Staff is visible and professional
✅ Marketing materials ready (professional folder)
✅ Sample meal prepared (showcase quality)

The tour is where families make their decision. Make it count.
```

**Post 3**:
```
Value Comparison Framework:

When families say "$8,500 is too much," show them:

Large Facility: $6,000 base + $500-1,500 add-ons = $6,500-7,500
Your AFH: $8,500 all-inclusive

Plus:
- 1:3 staff ratio vs 1:15-20
- <2 min response time vs 15-30 min
- Personalized care vs institutional

Frame it as value, not cost. They're not just buying care—they're buying peace of mind.

## Success Stories

### Thread 4: Transformation Story

**Post 1**:
```
From $27K to $57K monthly revenue: A real transformation story 📈

Sarah was running a 6-bed AFH with all Medicaid residents:
- $27K/month revenue
- $3-5K/month profit

## Quick Tips Series

### Thread 5: Daily Tips

**Post 1**:
```
Quick Tip Tuesday 💡

The "Admission Fee" isn't just revenue—it's a filter.

A $3,000 non-refundable admission fee:
✅ Filters out window shoppers
✅ Ensures serious clients
✅ Covers setup costs (assessment, training, coordination)
✅ Makes first 90 days profitable even if resident moves out

Frame it as "one-time setup fee" not "deposit."

This positions you as premium, not desperate.
```

### Thread 6: Common Mistakes

**Post 1**:
```
Common Mistake: Accepting any resident who needs care ❌

This is the "caregiver mindset" trap.

You end up with:
- Low-paying residents
- High-acuity cases you can't handle
- Financial strain
- Burnout

Better approach: Be selective ✅

Choose residents who:
- Can afford private-pay rates
- Match your care capabilities
- Fit your business model
- Have financial reserves (24+ months)

Selectivity = profitability.
